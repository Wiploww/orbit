# Orbit
Orbit is a minimal shadow puzzle game where the player must move the the sun to make sure the conditions of all of the cubes are met.

I began this project in Fall 2024 with grid paper, a flashlight, and board game pieces. Now, I'm making it into a digital puzzle game to share my idea with the world!
